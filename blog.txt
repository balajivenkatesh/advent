I started Advent of Code on Day 1: Thursday, November 30.
Blog started on Day 2: Friday, December 1.

Day 1: Website looks cool. Auth via github. Show self as anon_user_number.
Start writing code in python. Plan to redo in go.
Setup time was not too much. Virtualenv and vscode.
Two problems are easy. Need to plan more before writing code.
Invest in some way to test?

Day 2: Create a ip folder for storing inputs. git init - Initiated a git repo.
File has first line of comment as problem title.
File naming to d<number>p<1|2>.pythonIdea to blog.
Part 2 uses same input, so need to copy first part of p1 for file read into 2d array.
Both parts simple solution took 30 mins including some setup time.
Python breaking nested loops, put the nested loops part in a function and return.

Day 3: Doing next day, 2:30 PM. Made note on top of starting dates.
Took 2 hours. Too long. Need to focus.
